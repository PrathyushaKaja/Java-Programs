What is programming?
Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks in a specified manner”

Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language

Programming paradigm: 
Imperative programming (how to do) --> Procedural programming, structural programming, object-oriented programming
Declarative programming (what to do) --> Functional programming, logic programming, database programming

What is java?
Java is an object-oriented programming language designed to develop all kinds of applications

Who invented java and when it was invented?
1.	It was invented in June 1991 but the first version is officially released in 1996 by Sun MicroSystems
2.	Currently it is being maintained by oracle corporation

Full form of java?
There is no full form for java
Write once, run anywhere  java slogan

Advantages and disadvantages of java:
•	Simple
•	Object-oriented
•	Platform-independent  windows, MAC or linux it will work on any platform
•	Distributed 
•	Secure
•	Robust --> we can even extend the application

UI issues are the disadvantage for java language

Different technologies available in java:
Java SE --> standard edition --> Develop desktop/standalone (calculator etc.…) applications
Java EE --> Enterprise edition --> Develop web applications
Java ME --> Micro edition --> Embedded applications ex: coffee machine

What is core java and why it is popular?
1.	Core java contains the actual java programming and is widely in any kind of application development
2.	It is also used in software testing field

Data types in java:

What is a data type?
A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

Wrapper classes:
Integer --> Byte, Short, Integer, Long
Decimal --> Float, Double
Boolean, and Character

Primitive data types --> Integer Type: byte, short, int, long 
                         Decimal Type: float, double
                         Boolean: Boolean
                         Character: char
Based on size data types are divided

Computer Memory Units:
Bit --> binary digit --> least --> whatever we store in computer but internally it converts into bit and stores in it 
1 Nibble --> 4 bits 
1 Byte --> 8 bits 
1 Kilo byte (KB) --> 1024 bytes --> 1024/8  Ans
1 Mega byte (MB) --> downloads --> 1024 kilobyte 
1 Giga byte (GB) --> phones --> 1024 mega bytes
1 Tera byte (TB) --> hard disk --> 1024 giga bytes --> upto this we will use 
1 Peta byte (PB) --> 1024 tera bytes

Non-Primitive data types:
Non-primitive data types are not pre-defined 
This data types don’t have any size by default 
Arrays and collections will use primitive data types to store the values

By default, the value will be 0 for the integer and 0.0 for the decimal
And the value will be false for the Boolean and SPACE for the character
And there is no default value for the non-primitive data types

Variables in java:

What is a variable?
A variable is a container which holds the value/data while the java program is executed so that we can access the variable further.
Different type of variables in java:
1. Instance variables (non-static fields) --> global variables
2. Class variables (static fields) --> global variables
3. Local variables 
4. Parameters --> Local variables
                             
Variable syntax: DataType variableName = variableValue;


Naming conventions for the variables:
1.	Variables are case-sensitive
2.	Single word  lower case
3.	More than one word --> camel case --> ex:firstName
4.	We should not use the reserved keywords as the variable names as it is if we want to mention we have to extend that name 
5.	Don’t use short forms
6.	_, $  we can use this symbol in variable names. But cannot start with _ or $
7.	If the variable is constant like it contains permanent value then for that variable we have to use all capital letters and we have to mention _ underscore if there are more than one word
